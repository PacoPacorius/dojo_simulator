Dojo Simulator!

Train students! Participate in events! Challenge other dojos! Handle big egos
and drama! Manage the best martial arts school in the world! 
NEVER GIVE UP YOUR WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

kind-of wiki of things currently implemented

each student has physical stats:
1. flexibility
3. agility
4. strength
5. stamina 
6. weight class 

and skill stats:
1. kicking 
2. striking
3. holds

You can know how to kick wthout being very flexible, but not being very
flexible may put a cap on your kicking skill, same with striking & 
strength. Kicking is also dependent on agility, holds is not dependent in 
any physical skill (even an unfit student can learn holds if they work hard)

Weight class determines starting stat values and has bonuses or penalties
on a student's destiny values (see below).

Misc. physical stats:
1. Fatigue (high fatigue may lead to injury) -not implemented yet

Hidden / personality stats:
1. Motivation (if it gets low, the student might leave, if it remains high 
for a long time, the student might get a loyalty status ???) -not implemented
yet
2. Personality (determines when motivation goes up or down) -not implemented
yet
3. Destiny values for stats (natural affinity and potential for physical stats)
4. Teaching -not implemented yet

Game flow:
Advertise -> gradually gain new students who pay a monthly fee -> 
choose focus for each training session / each week -> students get better ->
exam to get new belt / participate in martial arts events -> students may
eventually leave -> new students

Long time students who have a high rank belt will teach lower ranks to
help them become better through their teaching skill

2. progression of stats
-------------------------
Physical stats;
Each time a student trains on a physical stat, he gains a clear 0.1 point before the modifiers. 
Modifiers are his hidden destiny value (affinity for the given field) in a percentage
and an age coefficient which is calculated by this formula (and later a training focus
modifier):

        current_age^2 
100% - ---------------  AGE IS NOT A FACTOR IN SKILL GAINS ANYMORE, will
        10000 - 256 

implement decline to due old age later down the road


So each time a student trains a physical stat sees an increase:

destiny_value_coefficient = ((destiny_value - (current_value - 20)) / 100)

physical stat increase = point * destiny_value_coefficient * training_coefficient


Skill stats: 
destiny_value_coefficient = ((destiny_value - (current_value - 20)) / 100)
training focus coefficient
physical stat dependence coeffiecient = physical stat / (skill stat + 20)
or if they depend on more than one physical stats: 1 / {number_of_stats} * physical stats / (skill stat + 20)
dependence on multiple stats can be weighted with coefficients, if n coefficients are less than 1, then {new_number_of_stats} = {number_of_stats} - n

skill stat increase = point * destiny_value_coefficient * dependence_coefficient * training_coefficient 


3. destiny value generation
----------------------------
Random with normal distribution

body types may add a small bonus or penalty to certain physical skills

4. training focus
------------------
General training: x1 modifier to everything
Focus on e.g. kicking: x1.5 modifier on kicking, x0.5 modifier on everything else

Focus is applied on one week only, on all three training sessions

Focus will affect student motivation depending on their personality. Some students 
might like kicking focus, cardio, or higher intensity training and if you go too
long without their preference they will lose motivation.

Three main categories:
1. Striking
2. Kicking
3. Holds

To implement in the future (only basic focuses and no focus are in the game):
You can upgrade your training focus for more efficient training by paying some
money and taking coach courses. For levels over Advanced you can only advance
through random special events

Striking |  Basic Striking  |   x1.25 striking, x0.75 strength, x0.5 everything else
         |  Inter. Strik.   |   x1.25 striking, x1 strength, x0.5 everything else
         |  Advanced Strik. |   x1.25 striking, x1 strength, x0.75 everything else
         |  Expert Striking |   x1.5 striking, x1 strength, x0.75 everything else
         |  Master Striking |   x1.5 striking, x1.25 strength, x1 everything else
         |  Legendary Str.  |   x2 striking, x1.5 strength, x1 everything else

Kicking  |  Basic Kicking   |   x1.25 kicking, x1 flexibility, x0.5 everything else

Holds    |  Basic Holds     |   x1.25 holds, x0.5 everything else

No Focus: x0.75 to all stats


5. stat history
-----------------
During the first week of every month, all stat increases of the last training
of the week are saved. You can view these later in order to determine the rate 
of growth of your students. Only the 60 previous stat increases are saved, meaning 
stat increases older than 5 years will be erased. 

As of right now, the leftmost value is the oldest one, going to newer values
as one reads to the right. 

6. student ranks -not implemented yet
-----------------

7. personality -not implemented yet
---------------

8. training intensity -not implemented yet
----------------------
low intensity: x0.75 modifier to all stat gains
medium intensity: x1 modifier to all stat gains
high intensity: x1.25 modifier to all stat gains

Intensity will affect student motivation depending on morale. High intensity
training will also increase student fatigue quicker and will increase risk 
of injury
