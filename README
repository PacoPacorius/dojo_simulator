Dojo Simulator!

Train students! Participate in events! Challenge other dojos! Handle big egos
and drama! Manage the best martial arts school in the world! 
NEVER GIVE UP YOUR WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

kind-of wiki of things currently implemented

Compile with "make all"

each student has physical stats:
1. flexibility
3. agility
4. strength
5. stamina 
6. weight class 

and skill stats:
1. kicking 
2. striking
3. holds

You can know how to kick wthout being very flexible, but not being very
flexible may put a cap on your kicking skill, same with striking & 
strength. Kicking is also dependent on agility, holds is not dependent in 
any physical skill (even an unfit student can learn holds if they work hard)

Weight class determines starting stat values and has bonuses or penalties
on a student's destiny values (see below).

Misc. physical stats:
1. Fatigue (high fatigue may lead to injury) -not implemented yet

Hidden / personality stats:
1. Motivation (if it gets low, the student might leave, if it remains high 
for a long time, the student might get a loyalty status ???) -not implemented
yet
2. Personality (determines when motivation goes up or down) -not implemented
yet
3. Destiny values for stats (natural affinity and potential for physical stats)
4. Teaching -not implemented yet

Game flow:
Advertise -> gradually gain new students who pay a monthly fee -> 
choose focus for each training session / each week -> students get better ->
exam to get new belt / participate in martial arts events -> students may
eventually leave -> new students

Long time students who have a high rank belt will teach lower ranks to
help them become better through their teaching skill

2. progression of stats
-------------------------
Physical stats;
Each time a student trains on a physical stat, he gains a clear 0.1 point before the modifiers. 
Modifiers are his hidden destiny value (affinity for the given field) in a percentage
and an age coefficient which is calculated by this formula (and later a training focus
modifier):

        current_age^2 
100% - ---------------  AGE IS NOT A FACTOR IN SKILL GAINS ANYMORE, will
        10000 - 256 

implement decline to due old age later down the road


So each time a student trains a physical stat sees an increase:

destiny_value_coefficient = ((destiny_value - (current_value - 20)) / 100)

physical stat increase = point * destiny_value_coefficient * training_coefficient


Skill stats: 
destiny_value_coefficient = ((destiny_value - (current_value - 20)) / 100)
training focus coefficient
physical stat dependence coeffiecient = physical stat / (skill stat + 20)
or if they depend on more than one physical stats: 1 / {number_of_stats} * physical stats / (skill stat + 20)
dependence on multiple stats can be weighted with coefficients, if n coefficients are less than 1, then {new_number_of_stats} = {number_of_stats} - n

skill stat increase = point * destiny_value_coefficient * dependence_coefficient * training_coefficient 


3. destiny value generation
----------------------------
Random with normal distribution

body types may add a small bonus or penalty to certain physical skills

====================================================================


4. training focus
------------------
General training: x1 modifier to everything
Focus on e.g. kicking: x1.5 modifier on kicking, x0.5 modifier on everything else

Focus is applied on one week only, on all three training sessions

Focus will affect student motivation depending on their personality. Some students 
might like kicking focus, cardio, or higher intensity training and if you go too
long without their preference they will lose motivation.

Three main categories:
1. Striking
2. Kicking
3. Holds

To implement in the future (only basic focuses and no focus are in the game):
You can upgrade your training focus for more efficient training by paying some
money and taking coach courses. For levels over Advanced you can only advance
through random special events

Striking |  Basic Striking  |   x1.25 striking, x0.75 strength, x0.5 everything else
         |  Inter. Strik.   |   x1.25 striking, x1 strength, x0.5 everything else
         |  Advanced Strik. |   x1.25 striking, x1 strength, x0.75 everything else
         |  Expert Striking |   x1.5 striking, x1 strength, x0.75 everything else
         |  Master Striking |   x1.5 striking, x1.25 strength, x1 everything else
         |  Legendary Str.  |   x2 striking, x1.5 strength, x1 everything else

Kicking  |  Basic Kicking   |   x1.25 kicking, x1 flexibility, x0.5 everything else

Holds    |  Basic Holds     |   x1.25 holds, x0.5 everything else

No Focus: x0.75 to all stats


5. stat history
-----------------
During the first week of every month, all stat increases of the last training
of the week are saved. You can view these later in order to determine the rate 
of growth of your students. Only the 60 previous stat increases are saved, meaning 
stat increases older than 5 years will be erased. 

As of right now, the leftmost value is the oldest one, going to newer values
as one reads to the right. 


6. training preference / motivation -not implemented yet
------------------------------------
Motivation shows how happy a student is with your dojo. A highly motivated
student will be less likely to leave, but you shouldn't expect an unmotivated
student to stick around for too long. Motivation naturally decreases over time
(-2 per week?). When a new student arrives they start with a motivation of 50. 

You can increase motivation by setting training focus according to your
students' training preference. Training preferences are:

1. Kicking
2. Striking
3. Holds
4. General
5. None 

If e.g. a student has a training preference for kicking and they participate in
training with kicking focus enabled, they will gain +5 motivation (can only
gain motivation this way once per week). Students with a general training 
preference like training with no focus and students with no preference will
gain +0.25 motivation per week regardless.

Right now training preference is generated to be completely random. When
personalities get added, it may be generated by the student's personality
(depending on what I settle on till then).

7. student leave and new students
----------------------------------

8. student belt ranks 
----------------------
a. white belt 
all newcomers start with this belt

b. white / yellow belt 

c. yellow belt

d. yellow / green belt

e. green belt

f. green / blue belt

g. blue belt

h. blue / red belt

i. red belt

j. red / black belt

k. black belt / 1st dan
All skills need to be over 40, at least one needs to be over 50
A student can only take a black belt test one year after gaining the red / black belt
rank.

(below ranks are not implemented yet)
Either hard limits to gain next rank or give the decision to the player on who to 
advance to the black belt rank. Black belts will be highly influential to the dojo's 
reputation depending on their skill (the higher the dan rank, the more pronounced the
effects) and will also help younger students develop quicker, take on
proteges, defend your dojo's honour against rival dojo attacks, etc. Black belts 
that aren't skilled enough will have a big negative impact on your dojo's reputation. 
If you choose not to award a student a black belt, or delay their advance in
rank, their motivation will drop rapidly.

l. black belt / 2nd dan
Any one skill stat over 70, all skill stats over 50
Can take test for 2nd dan only after two years after gaining 1st dan rank.
After 4 years, you can achieve 2nd dan rank only by having any one skill stat
over 70

m. black belt / 3rd rank
Any one skill stat over 80, all skill stats over 60
Can take exam three years after gaining 2nd dan rank.
After 6 years, you can achieve 



9. training intensity -not implemented yet
----------------------
low intensity: x0.75 modifier to all stat gains
medium intensity: x1 modifier to all stat gains
high intensity: x1.25 modifier to all stat gains

Intensity will affect student motivation depending on their personality. 
High intensity training will also increase student fatigue quicker and 
will increase risk of injury. (fatigue and injuries not implemented yet).
