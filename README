Dojo simulator! 

Train students! Participate in events! Challenge other dojos! Handle big egos and drama! Have the best martial arts school in the world! NEVER GIVE UP YOUR WAYYYYYY!!!!!

I haven't done much yet but it will get there eventually (and hopefully)

kind-of wiki of things currently implemented

each student has base stats:
1. flexibility
2. athleticism
3. agility
4. strength
5. stamina / cardio
6. weight class / physique

and skill(?) stats:
1. kicking 
2. striking
3. holds
4. grappling
5. forms

You can know how to kick wthout being very flexible, but not being very
flexible may put a cap on your kicking skill, same with striking & 
athleticism. Strength affects all skill stats except forms and holds
Weight class provides natural caps for kicking, striking etc. etc. Agility
affects kicking, forms

Misc. physical stats:
1. Fatigue (high fatigue may lead to injury)

Hidden / personality stats:
1. Motivation (if it gets low, the student might leave, if it remains high 
for a long time, the student might get a loyalty status ???)
2. Personality (determines when motivation goes up or down)
3. Destiny values for stats (natural affinity and potential for physical stats)
4. Teaching

Game flow:
Advertise -> gradually gain new students who pay a monthly fee -> 
choose focus for each training session / each week -> students get better ->
exam to get new belt / participate in martial arts events -> students may
eventually leave -> new students

Long time students who have a high rank belt will teach lower ranks to
help them become better through their teaching skill

2. progression of stats
-------------------------
Physical stats;
Each time a student trains on a physical stat, he gains a clear 0.1 point before the modifiers. 
Modifiers are his hidden destiny value (affinity for the given field) in a percentage
and an age coefficient which is calculated by this formula (and later a training focus
modifier):

        current_age^2 
100% - ---------------
        10000 - 256 

So each time a student trains in a specific field they gain:

destiny_value_coefficient = ((destiny_value - (current_value - 20)) / 100)
age_coefficient = (1 - (current_age - 16) / 100 )))
random_coefficient = 0-1.2f
training focus coefficient
physical stat increase = point * destiny_value_coefficient * age_coefficient * training_coefficient * random_coefficient -no age coefficent, implement decline, no random coefficient, not necessary


Skill stats: 
destiny_value_coefficient = ((destiny_value - (current_value - 20)) / 100)
training focus coefficient
physical stat dependence coeffiecient = physical stat / (skill stat + 20)
or if they depend on more than one physical stats: 1 / {number_of_stats} * physical stats / (skill stat + 20)
dependence on multiple stats can be weighted with coefficients, if n coefficients are less than 1, then {new_number_of_stats} = {number_of_stats} - n

skill stat increase = point * destiny_value_coefficient * dependence_coefficient * training_coefficient (* random coefficient? could work, but not really necessary, not as useless as it would havve been in physical stats. though)

Is there really a point for having destiny values for skill stats if they are influenced by destiny values of physical skills? defineitely if skill stat not depndent on other stat


3. destiny value generation
----------------------------
Random with normal distribution

body types may add a small bonus or penalty to certain physical skills

4. training focus
------------------
General training: x1 modifier to everything
Focus on e.g. kicking: x1.5 modifier on kicking, x0.5 modifier on everything else

Focus is applied on one week only, on all three training sessions

Focus will affect student motivation depending on their personality. Some students 
might like kicking focus, cardio, or higher intensity training and if you go too
long without their preference they will lose motivation.


5. training intensity
----------------------
low intensity: x0.75 modifier to all stat gains
medium intensity: x1 modifier to all stat gains
high intensity: x1.25 modifier to all stat gains

Intensity will affect student motivation depending on morale. High intensity
training will also increase student fatigue quicker and will increase risk 
of injury
