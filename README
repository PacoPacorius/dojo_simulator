Dojo Simulator!

Train students! Participate in events! Challenge other dojos! Handle big egos
and drama! Manage the best martial arts school in the world! 
NEVER GIVE UP YOUR WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

kind-of wiki of things currently implemented

Compile with "make all"

each student has physical stats:
1. flexibility
3. agility
4. strength
5. stamina 
6. weight class 

and skill stats:
1. kicking 
2. striking
3. holds

You can know how to kick wthout being very flexible, but not being very
flexible may put a cap on your kicking skill, same with striking & 
strength. Kicking is also dependent on agility, holds is not dependent in 
any physical skill (even an unfit student can learn holds if they work hard)

Weight class determines starting stat values and has bonuses or penalties
on a student's destiny values (see below).

Misc. physical stats:
1. Fatigue (high fatigue may lead to injury) -not implemented yet

Hidden / personality stats:
1. Motivation (if it gets low, the student might leave, if it remains high 
for a long time, the student might get a loyalty status ???) -not implemented
yet
2. Personality (determines when motivation goes up or down) -not implemented
yet
3. Destiny values for stats (natural affinity and potential for physical stats)
4. Teaching -not implemented yet

Game flow:
Advertise -> gradually gain new students who pay a monthly fee -> 
choose focus for each training session / each week -> students get better ->
exam to get new belt / participate in martial arts events -> students may
eventually leave -> new students

Long time students who have a high rank belt will teach lower ranks to
help them become better through their teaching skill

2. progression of stats
-------------------------
Physical stats;
Each time a student trains on a physical stat, he gains a clear 0.1 point before the modifiers. 
Modifiers are his hidden destiny value (affinity for the given field) in a percentage
and an age coefficient which is calculated by this formula (and later a training focus
modifier):

        current_age^2 
100% - ---------------  AGE IS NOT A FACTOR IN SKILL GAINS ANYMORE, will
        10000 - 256 

implement decline to due old age later down the road


So each time a student trains a physical stat sees an increase:

destiny_value_coefficient = ((destiny_value - (current_value - 20)) / 100)

physical stat increase = point * destiny_value_coefficient * training_coefficient


Skill stats: 
destiny_value_coefficient = ((destiny_value - (current_value - 20)) / 100)
training focus coefficient
physical stat dependence coeffiecient = physical stat / (skill stat + 20)
or if they depend on more than one physical stats: 1 / {number_of_stats} * physical stats / (skill stat + 20)
dependence on multiple stats can be weighted with coefficients, if n coefficients are less than 1, then {new_number_of_stats} = {number_of_stats} - n

skill stat increase = point * destiny_value_coefficient * dependence_coefficient * training_coefficient 


3. destiny value generation

Random with normal distribution

body types may add a small bonus or penalty to certain physical skills

====================================================================


4. training focus
------------------
General training: x1 modifier to everything
Focus on e.g. kicking: x1.5 modifier on kicking, x0.5 modifier on everything else

Focus is applied on one week only, on all three training sessions

Focus will affect student motivation depending on their personality. Some students 
might like kicking focus, cardio, or higher intensity training and if you go too
long without their preference they will lose motivation.

Three main categories:
1. Striking
2. Kicking
3. Holds

To implement in the future (only basic focuses and no focus are in the game):
You can upgrade your training focus for more efficient training by paying some
money and taking coach courses. For levels over Advanced you can only advance
through random special events

Striking |  Basic Striking  |   x1.25 striking, x0.75 strength, x0.5 everything else
         |  Inter. Strik.   |   x1.25 striking, x1 strength, x0.5 everything else
         |  Advanced Strik. |   x1.25 striking, x1 strength, x0.75 everything else
         |  Expert Striking |   x1.5 striking, x1 strength, x0.75 everything else
         |  Master Striking |   x1.5 striking, x1.25 strength, x1 everything else
         |  Legendary Str.  |   x2 striking, x1.5 strength, x1 everything else

Kicking  |  Basic Kicking   |   x1.25 kicking, x1 flexibility, x0.5 everything else

Holds    |  Basic Holds     |   x1.25 holds, x0.5 everything else

No Focus: x0.75 to all stats


5. stat history
-----------------
During the first week of every month, all stat increases of the last training
of the week are saved. You can view these later in order to determine the rate 
of growth of your students. Only the 60 previous stat increases are saved, meaning 
stat increases older than 5 years will be erased. 

As of right now, the leftmost value is the oldest one, going to newer values
as one reads to the right. 


6. training preference / motivation / personality
--------------------------------------------------
Motivation shows how happy a student is with your dojo. A highly motivated
student will be less likely to leave, but you shouldn't expect an unmotivated
student to stick around for too long. Motivation naturally decreases over time
(-2 per week?). When a new student arrives they start with a motivation of 50. 

You can increase motivation by setting training focus according to your
students' training preference. Training preferences are:

1. Kicking
2. Striking
3. Holds
4. General
5. None 

If e.g. a student has a training preference for kicking and they participate in
training with kicking focus enabled, they will gain +5 motivation (can only
gain motivation this way once per week). Students with a general training 
preference like training with no focus and students with no preference will
gain +0.25 motivation per week regardless.

Right now training preference is generated to be completely random. When
personalities get added, it may be generated by the student's personality
(depending on what I settle on till then).

Personalities also affect morale
Personalities:

a. Driven: Will get sad if they don't regularly participate in events,
slightly faster stat gain in all stats. Gain morale each time they participate
in an event. Will lose morale if participating in low intensity training and
will gain morale when participating in low intensity training.

b. Impatient: Will get sad if their stats don't improve fast enough. Will
slightly gain morale when participating in high intensity training.

c. Worshipper: Will get sad if you don't have more than 4 black belts in your
dojo, will be really happy otherwise. 

d. Weeb: Will get happy if your dojo has another weeb in it. Everybody else
gets sad for each student with Weeb personality.

e. Social: Will gain morale for each other social student you have in your
dojo. When relationships are implemented, they will be really happy when they
make friends and really uhnappy when disliked.

f. Antisocial: Will lose morale for every social student you have in your
dojo.

g. Lazy: Massive morale loss if made to participate in events. Slight morale
loss when taking part in high intensity training, morale gain when
participating in low intensity training.

h. Jealous: Loses morale for each student in the same belt rank that has
better stats.

i. Respectful: Will gain morale for each student in the same rank that has
better stats (basically the inverse of jealous personality).

j. Unmotivated: Morale loss for high intensity training, slower stat growth

to implement when relationships are implemented 
k. Troublemaker: will gain morale if people dislike them, will cause trouble
when implemented.

l. Loner: will lose morale if people like him, will gain morale if they have no
relationship with the rest of the students.

m. Insecure: will lose morale if they have no realtionships with other
students (negative relationships count).

n. Socialist: will lose morale if you advertise for new students, will gain
morale if there are mentor relationships in the dojo

7. student belt ranks 
----------------------
a. white belt 
all newcomers start with this belt

b. white / yellow belt 

c. yellow belt

d. yellow / green belt

e. green belt

f. green / blue belt

g. blue belt

h. blue / red belt

i. red belt

j. red / black belt

k. black belt / 1st dan
All skills need to be over 40, at least one needs to be over 50 -this will
when black belts get a makeover, below these values they will generate
negative effects for the dojo

A student can only take a black belt test at least one year after gaining the red / black 
belt rank and only in January. That makes the maximum possible time to take a
test for the black belt 1.5 years and the minimum 1 year.

Each time a student climbs in rank, they get a +10 boost in motivation. An
exception to this is gaining the black belt rank, which gets them +30 motivation.

(below ranks are not implemented yet)
Either hard limits to gain next rank or give the decision to the player on who to 
advance to the black belt rank. Black belts will be highly influential to the dojo's 
reputation depending on their skill (the higher the dan rank, the more pronounced the
effects) and will also help younger students develop quicker, take on
proteges, defend your dojo's honour against rival dojo attacks, etc. Black belts 
that aren't skilled enough will have a big negative impact on your dojo's reputation. 
If you choose not to award a student a black belt, or delay their advance in
rank, their motivation will drop rapidly.

l. black belt / 2nd dan
Any one skill stat over 70, all skill stats over 50
Can take test for 2nd dan only after two years after gaining 1st dan rank.
After 4 years, you can achieve 2nd dan rank only by having any one skill stat
over 70

m. black belt / 3rd dan
Any one skill stat over 80, all skill stats over 60
Can take exam three years after gaining 2nd dan rank.
After 6 years, you can achieve 

n. black belt / 4th dan
This test requires the student to undergo a teaching course. 
Teaching skill over 60, requirements from the 3rd dan still apply.

As the dojo owner, you start out at the 4th dan rank yourself. Therefore you
are only allowed to award up to the 3rd dan rank to your students. To award
4th or higher dan ranks you need to up your rank as well by taking a test in
the region's most prestigious dojo. -idea, implement player character as a
special student? nahh, just have the player pay to get to higher ranks


8. student leave and new students
----------------------------------
How should I go about this?

As of now, students leave only because of low morale and there is no
difference between new and old students. Students also have a 1/10000 chance
to just leave with no explanation. The rest are all future plans:

The first six months should be very volatile. The six months after that also,
but not as much. New students are much harder to please, negative morale effects
are huge and so they may leave at a moment's notice. After that, it's mostly 
smooth sailing till the black belt.

Upon gaining the black belt, students, depending on their personality, have a
chance of just plain giving up and pursuing other passions. Even if they do
stay, however, black belts are really tough to handle and touchy and if not
kept happy could jump ship at any time.

If the student's motivation is kept over 80 for an extended period of time
(say two years?), they gain loyalty towards you, which means that it will be
very rare for them to leave, even if their morale is abysmal. They will never
give up upon reaching black belt status. (maybe some bonus? maybe sumin extra?
maybe give the dojo more prestige or somethin i dunno)

There is a small possibility that students leave regardless of what you do due
to major changes in their life like changing where they live, a massive
injury, having kids etc. It's just the unfair way life works, I guess.

New students will be determined by the dojo's prestige, but I think a good
number is 2-6 new students every year. I should probably not worry about this
too much, though, need to implement student leave to work out the numbers
well.



9. training intensity -not implemented yet
----------------------
low intensity: x0.75 modifier to all stat gains
medium intensity: x1 modifier to all stat gains
high intensity: x1.25 modifier to all stat gains

Intensity will affect student motivation depending on their personality. 
High intensity training will also increase student fatigue quicker and 
will increase risk of injury. (fatigue and injuries not implemented yet).

10. money handling / advertising
---------------------------------
Money makes the world go round.

Each student pays you 100€ a month. Starting dojo rent is 500€, and
your initial budget is 1000€. If you are in debt for three months
straight, your dojo closes and you go bankrupt, GAME OVER! 

/* advertising is not yet implemented
 */
Apart from the standard yearly batch of students in September, you can
advertise to get a few students immediately. Here the options for advertising:

Posters & flyers locally: 200€, 0-3 students next week
Billboards & Newspaper ads: 800€, 0-6 students next week
TV & radio ads: 2000€, 2-8 students next week

This is the only use for money at the moment
Future uses: participation in events requires a participation fee, the higher
the event rank, the pricier it is to participate


11. events
-----------

This one's gonna be a long one.

Every 

xx. command line options
-------------------------

There is one command line option you can pass when running the executable for
debug purposes.

Specifying --happy-times when running the dojo exec file will stop students
from leaving your dojo due to morale reasons.
