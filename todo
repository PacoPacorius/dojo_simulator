keep track of stat increases, stat history
stat increases for the last 6 months, every month (how will you know when

use queues instead of stacks -done

make stat history for the rest of the stats too -done

stat history, a documentation of everyone's stats every 6 months for 
the past 5 years -do this later, stat increases are more important now i think
