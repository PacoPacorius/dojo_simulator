generate some workers done

hidden destiny values -how do they work?
they are percentages


student growth -done

destiny values generation -done

split main.c into multiple files -how?
generation is one file, main.c another -done

first school - train 5 students at the same time -done

training focus -done

keep track of stat increases, stat history
stat increases for the last 6 months, every month (how will you know when
a focus was used?) the focus will also be stored -stored the stat increase, need 
to store the focus too, storing the focus doesnt seem all that necessary rn

fix 5 year segfault, look how i handle overflows in my fun stack implementation, should be really fun
use queues instead of stacks -done

make stat history for the rest of the stats too -done

stat history, a documentation of everyone's stats every 6 months for 
the past 5 years -do this later, stat increases are more important now i think

personalities, only training preference for now -done

motivation -done

belt progression until black belt, belt exams -done, but very cosmetically, has no real current use apart from motivation gains

student leave (plus a very easy way to turn it off for testing purposes) -done, polish mechanic when student arrival is implemented
student arrival -done

random names -done
implement them in the game! -done

money handling, bills to pay -done

events

training intensity 

more personality

advertising (either before or after personality, make dojo start with 0 students and to have to advertise, give less students each September)

sdl ui

polish student leave mechanic (volatile first few months, more stable as time goes on, loyalty)

*** Known bugs ***
When looking at students' stats in the first week of september, new students are added each time the main screen shows up -fixed
When the dojo has zero students, you can get soft-locked in the show student stats and show student stat history screens -fixed
Can't see stats of any student after the tenth student has arrived, it's the way I handle the character input thingy (how will I fix this? scanf and convert to string / char?) -fixed, scanf was the solution
